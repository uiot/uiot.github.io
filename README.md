What is UIoT
-------------

UIoT is an open-source middleware dedicated to managing services in Internet-of-Things environments. It is designed to transparently allow control of any component able to communicate information. 

Why UIoT
--------

UIoT offers a standardized API with intuitive and simplified ways to add new devices. UIoT is simple, secure and easy to deploy. IoT and the amazing things it can achieve are already known by a lot of people. 

How UIoT works?
---------------

Based on Universal Plug and Play pattern, UIoT discovers all devices which are able to communicate and use then to create an IoT network. UIoT also provides execution capabilities on IoT objects. 

Documentation
-------------

To learn about how it works, please start visiting our website at [uiot.org](https://uiot.org) and, after that, read contents in this repositry's [docs folder](https://github.com/UIoT/UIoT/tree/master/docs). They are divided as follows:

* [Website with hints](https://uiot.org/)
* [Complete Architectural and Communication Model reference in Portuguese](https://github.com/UIoT/UIoT/tree/master/docs/UIoT_Hiro_Dissertation.pdf)
* [Docs for quick references](https://github.com/UIoT/UIoT/tree/master/docs/presentations)
* [Scientific Papers ](https://github.com/UIoT/UIoT/tree/master/docs/papers)

### Available Docs

Available Docs for Community in <i>actual</i> state.

1. *UIoT's REST API Proposal*
 This paper is the about the first concept of our RESTapi implementation, that futurely is denominated as our Service Layer, *this paper is old and outdated and with old statements and informations about the layer*
2. *UIoT's Security Approach*
 This paper is about our first concept about of Handle Security in an IoT ecosystem/network, *this paper is old and outdated and with old informations about our approach*

### What can I search?

Regarding some info for you,

* All repositories are currently private, until we finish the basics to display for you.
* Only some docs (papers/articles/power points/etc) are available for community, until we publishes it.
* UIoT is in management stage, that means that we're not ready for community. when we finish setting all the things to we be ready for you.
* Web Site is under development.
* More data and explanations will be released later.
* If you have any questions feel to enter in contact with us at contact@uiot.org
